# Todo App

This project is a complete Angular Todo App that connects to an external API to manage todos. Users can add, delete, update, and mark todos as completed. The app provides a smooth user experience, ensuring data persistence through API integration. It demonstrates practical usage of React components, hooks, and asynchronous API requests using modern JavaScript (ES6+).

- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface for managing todos with ease.
